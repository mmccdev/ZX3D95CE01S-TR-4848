assume 64K data File
: 1 week every 5 minutes 4 long longs
7 * 24 * 12 (8 * 4) = 64512   + 1024 (spare / header or footer) = 65536
maybe blocks of 32 bytes (8 * 4)

looks promising http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html although i want to access flash

nvs seems simpler

nvs = simple but very wastefull in terms of memory usagage (can't even store 100 times struct of (4 long long's 32 bytes))
